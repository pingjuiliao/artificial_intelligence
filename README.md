# Aritificial Intelligence
I learned AI by implementing the following projects.  
I believe by actually coding the machine learning algorithm and applying it  
on the problem are the way to improve my skills in AI.
## Machine Learning
| Project   | Progress                          | License            |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Pacman    | Reinforcement Learning Done (3/5) | Bekeley            |
| Octave    | Done (8/8)                        | Stanford/ Coursera |
| Tensorflow| These are just some notes         | Coursera           |
